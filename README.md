# Beers in the Middle üçª

BITM helps groups of friends find the perfect place to meet for drinks or food by finding the average distance between each friend. Using the Foursquare API we're able to find the best bars, restaurants and clubs for you and your friends to have the best evening out at the most convenient place for all.
